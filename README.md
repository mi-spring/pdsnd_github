### Project Title

The data includes information of rental ride:
- Start Time

In this project, I write codes to provide the following investigation;
1. Popular times of travel
2. Popular stations and trip
3. Trip duration
4. User info


### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv


### Credits

I consulted several websites to write a code;
[Datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
[value_counts](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html)
